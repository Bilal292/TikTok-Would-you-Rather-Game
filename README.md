# TikTok-Would-you-Rather-Game

Using the tkinter GUI library in python, I created a would you rather game.

Using TikTokLive library, I connect to my live on TikTok and read live chat comments.

As the game is being screen shared on Tiktok Live, live viewers can vote by typing 'red' or 'blue' in the chat.
The vote increments and the live viewers can see which option has the most votes, and after 35 seconds, new options appear for live viewers to vote on.
